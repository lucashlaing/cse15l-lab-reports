# Lab Report 3
## Part 1: Bugs


For bugs, we will be looking at the  `reversed` method from week 4. It is supposed to reverse the array that is passed in as a parameter. For example, an array with the elements `{1, 2}` should change to `{2, 1}` after a call to the  `reversed` method with said array as an argument. However, this method does not work as intended.


### A failure-inducing input
```
  @Test 
  public void testReverseInPlace() {
    int[] input1 = { 3,5,1 };
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 1,5,3 }, input1);
  }
```


### An input that does not cause a failure 

```
  @Test 
  public void testReverseInPlace2() {
    int[] input1 = { 3 };
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 3 }, input1);
  }
```


### The initial code that was causing the failure
```
  static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
  }
```


### The fixed version of the code
```
  static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length/2; i += 1) {
      int temp = arr[arr.length- i - 1];
      arr[arr.length- i - 1] = arr[i];
      arr[i] = temp;
    }
  }
```


The problem with the initial code was taking the elements from the end of the array and putting them at the front of the array. However, once we get to the second half of the array, we realize that the elements initially at the start of the array have been overwritten and therefore cannot be copied to the back. This just creates an array which is like a palindrome. Our code fixes the problem because we only go to half the array. We start from both ends and swap each of these elements with one another. This ensures we have all the data we need and nothing gets overwritten before it is put into another spot.


## Part 2: Researching Commands


For this part, we will be looking at the command `grep`. These command line options were found [from the geeksforgeeks website here.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/)

### `grep -i`

#### Example 1
```

This is finding all the lines where abuse was written, regardless of upper or lower case. This is useful because we could miss some words if we did not have this command line option. 

#### Example 2

```
minzi@Lucas-Laptop MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/docsearch/technical/government/About_LSC (main)
$ grep -i jUsTice diversity_priorities.txt

```
This finds all the instances of the word "justice" in this file regardless of the case. This command line option can also be useful when we end up capitalizing our arguments in weird places. 


### `grep -n`

#### Example 1
```
minzi@Lucas-Laptop MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/docsearch/technical/biomed (main)
$ grep -n development 1471-213X-1-2.txt 
7:        cellular behaviors. It is essential for animal development,
35:        stages of development by fluorescence microscopy of GFP
113:        in development,

This find all instances of "development" in the file and tells which line it is located in. This is useful since it allows us to easily locate each instance. 

#### Example 2
```

```
This finds all the instances of "gene" in the text and tells us which line number it is at. This could be useful when dealing with large code files so we know exactly where to find a variable being used. 

### `grep -r`

#### Example 1
```
$ grep -r tumours ./
./journal.pbio.0020040.txt:        tumours in these predisposed patients, the remaining wild-type copy of the tumour

./journal.pbio.0020040.txt:        was expected that in these tumours this copy would have been lost or inactivated. However,  
./journal.pbio.0020040.txt:        this turned out not to be the case. Half of the tumours from mice younger than 18 months

./journal.pbio.0020040.txt:        tumours was able to bind to a p53-binding DNA sequence in an in vitro setting. Finally,     
./journal.pbio.0020040.txt:        since it is known that p53 absence in tumours is correlated with chromosomal instability,

```
This finds all instances of the word tumour in the directory `/plos`. This is useful when we want to find a certain word in several different files

#### Example 2
```
minzi@Lucas-Laptop MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/docsearch/technical/plos (main)
$ grep -r Alfred ./
./journal.pbio.0020040.txt:        postulated in Alfred Knudson's (1971) two-hit model. And, indeed, it was shown that in the

./pmed.0010013.txt:        consider Dennis Burkitt's report on jaw tumors in African children, Alfred Blalock's
```
This finds all mentions of "Alfred" in the directory `/plos`. This helps find how many times a certain researcher or research paper is mentioned.
