## `cd` with no arguments
![Image](CdNoArg.png)


The working directory was `/home` when the code was run. `cd` does not have any output and it worked as expected. As there was no argument, the directory we were in did not change as we can see in the next line. The output is not an error but this line was pointless as it did nothing.


## `cd` with directory as argument

The working directory was `/home` when the code was run. `cd` does not have any output and it worked as expected. We changed our working directory to `/home/lecture1` and we can see this in the next line. The output is not an error since we switched directories like we wanted.


## `cd` with file as argument

The working directory was `/home/lecture1` when the code was run. `cd` gave an error output as the code did not work as expected. We could not change our directory to `Hello.java` because it is a file and not a folder/directory.


## `ls` with no argument


The working directory was `/home/lecture1` when the code was run. `ls` gave an output of all the files and folders that are inside the lecture1 folder. Having no arguments meant that we wanted to know all the files and folders in the current directory. There were no errors.

## `ls` with directory as argument


The working directory was `/home/lecture1` when the code was run. `ls` gave an output of all the files that were inside the messages folder. As we passed in the messages path as an arugment, `ls` showed all the files inside of it. There were no errors.

## `ls` with file as argument


The working directory was `/home/lecture1` when the code was run.`ls` returned the name of the file we passed in as an argument. There were no errors but this was pointless as we did not find out what was inside the file.
