## `cd` with no arguments
![Image](CdNoArg.png)


The working directory was `/home` when the code was run. `cd` does not have any output and it worked as expected. As there was no argument, the directory we were in did not change as we can see in the next line. The output is not an error but this line was pointless as it did nothing.


## `cd` with directory as argument\
![Image](CdArgDirect.png)


The working directory was `/home` when the code was run. `cd` does not have any output and it worked as expected. We changed our working directory to `/home/lecture1` and we can see this in the next line. The output is not an error since we switched directories like we wanted.


## `cd` with file as argument\
![Image](CdArgFile.png)


The working directory was `/home/lecture1` when the code was run. `cd` gave an error output as the code did not work as expected. We could not change our directory to `Hello.java` because it is a file and not a folder/directory.
